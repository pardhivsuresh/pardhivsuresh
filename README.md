👋 Hi, I’m @pardhivsuresh

👀 I’m interested in: Data Science, FinTech, and solving real-world business puzzles through data. Beyond the screen, I am an avid traveler and photographer with a keen eye for capturing patterns in both nature and datasets.

🌱 I’m currently learning: Advanced Python for Risk Modeling, SQL optimization, and Fraud Detection typologies. I am also focused on applying my classroom knowledge to hands-on, offline project experiences to bridge the gap between theory and execution.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: Open-source Data Analytics projects, Predictive Modeling for security, or any initiative that uses Data Viz (Power BI/Tableau) to simplify complex information. I am also open to travel-related tech projects or data expeditions!
